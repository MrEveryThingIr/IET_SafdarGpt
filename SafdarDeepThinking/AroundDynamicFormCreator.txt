I'm going to create a system for creating any types of forms all by the user via DeveloperGraphicalInterface

I'd like to generate structured controllers somehow , a controller should be used for developer interface UI,
including methods such as the following:
-show_createform_form
-preview_posted_form
-store_created_form
-load_all_created_forms
-load_one_form_by_name
-update_one_form_by_name


then other controllers should be used for CRUD_queries , show , index,create,delete,update and more...
